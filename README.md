# webpack-multipage-setup
In progress: Basic configuration for webpack working with multipages and focused on performance.

## What this setup does?
* Generate HTML from templates
* Creates as many pages as you want
* Split CSS files into mediaqueries (mobile first) to imrpove load times
* Check errors in the HTML at build time (tags, accessibility...)
* Compiles JS to make it crossbrowser (need to specify the browser list)
* To be continued
